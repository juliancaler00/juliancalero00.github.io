        <h1>A topic I find intresting: old cars</h1>
        <p>
            I really like working on cars but for the most part only older ones. Working on old cars is a blast, but it's not always easy. 
            <strong>There's a lot that can go wrong</strong>, from missing part completely or finicky engines. But when you finally finish the project and make it go faster or run at all, the feeling of accomplishment is unbeatable. 
            There's also just something about getting your hands dirty and tinkering with mechanical parts that is so satisfying.
             Esspecially when i work on computers all day.
             I attached a link below to starlink, roaming. which I'm adding to my old van so I can work from anywhere while im traveling.
             I also added a picture of a van that looks simalar to mine.
